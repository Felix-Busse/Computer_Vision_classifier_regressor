# Computer-Vision classifier regressor

## How to
Clone this repository and explore the generation of **image data** and the use of **neuronal networks** on different tasks on these data in [Jupyter-Notebook](comparing_dense_to_conv_networks.ipynb).

## Description
The generated data consists of colored squares and circles in images. Performance of **densly connected neuronal networks** are compared to **convolutional neuronal networks**. 

As tasks **classification** of squares/circles or **regression** on the size of squares/circle is used. Noise is added to investigate its impact. Typical challanges in training of neuronal networks such as overfitting are encountered and **hyperparameter tuning** of convolutional neuronal networks investigated.
